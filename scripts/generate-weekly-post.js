# How to Spot Roof Damage After a Maryland Storm

Maryland's weather can be unpredictable, with severe storms, high winds, and hail causing significant damage to residential roofs. As a homeowner, knowing how to identify storm damage early can save you thousands in repairs and prevent further damage to your home.

After a storm, walk around your property and look for:

Hail damage often appears as:
- Circular dents in metal components

# Should You Repair or Replace Your Roof in Anne Arundel County?

One of the most challenging decisions Anne Arundel County homeowners face is whether to repair their existing roof or invest in a complete replacement. This decision impacts both your immediate budget and long-term home value.

## When Roof Repair Makes Sense

### Minor Issues (Repair Recommended)
- **Few missing shingles** (less than 10% of roof)
- **Small leaks** in isolated areas
- **Damaged flashing** around chimneys or vents
- **Roof age under 15 years** with good overall condition

### Cost Considerations
Repairs typically cost $300-$1,500 for minor issues, making them attractive for:
- Recent storm damage
- Isolated problem areas
- Newer roofs with warranty coverage

## When Roof Replacement is Necessary

### Major Red Flags (Replace Recommended)
- **Roof age over 20 years** (asphalt shingles)
- **Multiple leak points** throughout the roof
- **Extensive shingle damage** (over 30% of roof)
- **Sagging roof deck** or structural issues
- **Repeated repair needs** over 2-3 years

### Long-term Value
Complete replacement offers:
- **20-30 year warranty** on materials and labor
- **Increased home value** (up to $15,000-$25,000)
- **Energy efficiency** improvements
- **Peace of mind** with comprehensive coverage

## Anne Arundel County Specific Considerations

### Climate Factors
- **Coastal moisture** accelerates aging
- **Hurricane season** requires sturdy materials
- **Temperature fluctuations** cause expansion/contraction
- **Ice dam potential** in northern areas

### Local Building Codes
Anne Arundel County requires:
- Proper permits for major repairs
- Wind-resistant materials in coastal zones
- Updated ventilation standards
- Professional installation certification

## Making the Right Decision

### Questions to Ask Yourself:
1. How old is your current roof?
2. How many repairs have you made in the last 5 years?
3. Are you planning to sell within 10 years?
4. What's your long-term budget for home maintenance?
